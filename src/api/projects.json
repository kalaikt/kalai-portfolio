Tiny in size and massive in ability, the 1.8-ounce Ocean Medallion is the shape of a quarter and stores the information that travelers provide- not just online before the trip but also in real time as the device is powered through another creation, the company's Ocean Compass digital concierge. You can wear the Medallion around your wrist (like an Apple Watch), around your neck (like a pendant) or just carry it in your pocket. Benefits of Ocean Medallion include streamlined embarkation and debarkation, the ability to locate friends and family throughout the ship, better interactions with crew members who also will have devices and easier ways to access dining and entertainment throughout the cruise.",
